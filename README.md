SYSTEM DESIGN
Introduction
The design approach of our solution is characterized by the parallel implementation 
of firewalls and honeypots. This dual-processing system ensures that incoming 
network requests undergo a comprehensive analysis, offering a multi-faceted 
perspective on their security implications. The design also includes a secondary 
firewall, which uses the insights from both components to make informed decisions. 
The system accommodates nine possible scenarios for handling requests, ranging 
from straightforward approvals to deep packet inspection.
Functionality:
Parallel Analysis: The system operates by simultaneously directing 
incoming network requests to the firewall and honeypot components 
for analysis.
Firewall Analysis: The firewall evaluates requests based on predefined 
rules and known threats, blocking malicious requests.
Honeypot Analysis: The honeypot analyzes the behavior and intent of 
requests, logging suspicious activities.
Secondary Firewall Decision: A secondary firewall takes the results 
of both analyses to make informed decisions, leading to one of nine 
possible scenarios.
Deep Packet Inspection: When necessary, the system conducts deep 
packet inspection to understand the intent behind requests.
Database Updates: All components update a shared database with 
information on threats, decision logs, and behavioral patterns.
Advantages:
Comprehensive Security: The parallel implementation ensures that 
every request undergoes a multi-faceted analysis, enhancing security.
Real-Time Decision-Making: Simultaneous analysis reduces response 
times, allowing for quicker threat mitigation and reducing potential 
damage.

Adaptability: Machine learning and behavioral analysis enable the 
system to adapt to emerging threats, improving its effectiveness over 
time.
Advanced Threat Handling: Complex threats, including zero-day 
exploits, are addressed through deep packet inspection and behavioral 
analysis.
Efficient Database Updates: The shared database ensures that the 
system remains current and can learn from past incidents to better 
Counter future threats.
